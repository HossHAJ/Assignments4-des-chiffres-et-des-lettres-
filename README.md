## Round Letters - Des Chiffres et des Lettres
### Overview
The Letters Round is an essential part of the classic intellectual game Des Chiffres et Des Lettres. During this round the player selects a sequence of letters (vowels and consonants) and attempts to make the longest correct word from these letters. At this iteration, the game concentrates on the Letters Round where players choose letters and create words.
### Rules
- The player chooses 10 letters in turn.
- You choose to have a vowel or a consonant for each letter.
- Program here can randomly choose a letter from the selected category:
- Get a random selection from the vowels A, E, I, O, U.
- Random Consonants: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,P,Q,R,S,T,V,W,X,Y,Z
- Once all 10 letters have been generated, the player has to form the longest word that they can out of those 10 letters
- From here, the game can test if the player's word is anything but up to the longest word in English and give feedback as well as score the player.
### How to Play
- Run the program: The game will tell you to either select a vowel or consonant for all of the first 10 letters.(
- Your options: Type vowel or consonant as the answer to each prompt
- Form your word â€” try to form the longest valid word possible using all 10 letters chosen
- Submit your word: When asked, type in the word you have formed.
- Scoring: The game calculates your score by comparing your word's length with the longest possible word that could be formed from the given letters.

## Numbers Round - Des Chiffres et Des Lettres
### Overview
The Numbers Round is one of the two main rounds of the popular game Des Chiffres et Des Lettres. In this round, players are given a set of numbers and are required to perform basic arithmetic operations to reach or get as close as possible to a randomly generated target number. This version of the game focuses on implementing the Numbers Round, where players are tested on their arithmetic skills and strategy.
### Rules
- The program generates six random numbers from two groups:
- Large numbers: 25, 50, 75, 100
- Small numbers: Integers between 1 and 10
- The program generates a random three-digit target number between 100 and 999.
- The player is required to use the six numbers and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, //) to calculate an expression as close as possible to the target number.
- Each number can only be used once in the expression.
- The player enters their expression, and the program calculates the result and the difference from the target number.
- The program also allows for an automatic solution using a brute-force approach to find the best possible solution for the numbers round.
### How to Play
- Start the program: The program will display a randomly generated target number and a set of six random numbers.
- Formulate your expression: Using the six numbers, perform arithmetic operations to get as close as possible to the target number. You can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and integer division (//).
- Input your expression: Once you've created your expression, enter it into the program.
- See your result: The program will evaluate your expression and calculate how close you were to the target.
- Check the best solution (optional): The program can automatically calculate the closest solution using brute-force methods, showing you the best possible expression.
