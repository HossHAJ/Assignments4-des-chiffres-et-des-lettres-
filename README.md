# Letters round
The player is given a set of letters one by one. At each step, the player is asked whether
a vowel or a consonant should be provided and the computer generates a random letter
corresponding to the player’s choice.
The player will, then, have to use these letters to create the longest valid word. The
player must provide his word within a limited amount of time. But this time constraint
is waived in this assignment.
# Numbers round
Players are given a set of six numbers, typically consisting of small numbers (1-10) and
large numbers from the list (25, 50, 75, 100).
A three-digit target number is randomly generated. Players must use any combination of
1
the random numbers and basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, //) to reach the target
number. The closest guess to the target number using valid operations wins.
